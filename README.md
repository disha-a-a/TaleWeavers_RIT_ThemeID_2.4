# üå≥ ChronoAlcles: Interactive AI-Powered Moral Storytelling

**Contest:** Samsung PRISM GenAI Hackathon 2025
**Team Name:** Tale Weavers
**Theme:** Interactive Storytelling, Gameplay, and Virtual Companionship

## üìú Project Overview

ChronAlcles is an interactive storytelling platform that teaches children core moral values through active, choice-driven narratives. It leverages **Gemini 2.5 Flash** for dynamic story generation, enabling a unique, personalized moral learning journey for every child.

## üéØ Purpose of Project
The core purpose of ChronAicles is to bridge the gap between traditional, passive moral education and the digital, interactive learning styles of modern children. We aim to create a child-safe, highly engaging environment where ethical decisions have immediate, visible consequences, fostering empathy, critical thinking, and responsible decision-making in a way that static content cannot. Our goal is to position Samsung as a leader in providing responsible, ethical AI tools for family education.

### Key Features
1.  **Dynamic Story Generation:** Uses **Gemini 2.5 Flash** to instantly generate the next chapter of the story based on user choices.
2.  **Multimodal Experience:** Integrates dynamic background illustrations and customizable text-to-speech narration (via gTTS).
3.  **Moral & Reflection Loop:** Every decision is tied to an ethical outcome, concluding with a gentle, customized summary of the lesson learned.
4.  **Tech Stack:** Python 3.11, Streamlit, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Hugging Face (for image generation).
